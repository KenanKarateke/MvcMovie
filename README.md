The guide to deploy an ASP.NET Core web app with a SQL Database in Azure:

Run the Sample Locally (via GitHub Codespaces):

Fork the repo and create a Codespace.
In the terminal, run:

dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
Access the app at http://localhost:5093.
Quick Deploy with Azure Developer CLI (azd):

Log in to Azure:

azd auth login
Provision and deploy:

azd up
After deployment, visit the endpoint URI provided.
Database Migration Automation:

Migrations are handled via a self-contained migrations bundle.
The azure.yaml uses a prepackage hook to generate the bundle, and it's included in the deployment.
Password Management:

SQL and Redis Cache secrets are stored in a Key Vault with private endpoint access.
The database password is automatically generated and updated with each deployment.
For more details or troubleshooting, check the projectâ€™s Issues section.
